## Pax L1400 Elys Workstation Overview





### Hub
The solution will come with a small, dongle-like component called the "hub" and a power brick.

The hub contains 2x ethernet ports, 4x USB A ports, 2x RJ45 RS232 ports (unused), a power-only USB-C In port, and a fixed USB-C right-angled output cable that connects to the station.

The system components come with right-angle cables that will flat-mount to those ports. Typically, any connected devices would connect to the hub. The example above has both ports in use, but this is not a typical solution. 

Example configuraiton:
* L1400 connected to the hub
* Hub connected to power
* Hub connected to ethernet
* Printer connected via ethernet to hub
* cash drawer connected to printer via RJ45
* Barcode scanner connected to hub

Note that most barcode scanners will be bluetooth, and use bluetooth for connectivity. THe USB would just be for charging.
