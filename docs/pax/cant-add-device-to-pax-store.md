## Symptoms
You cannot add a PAX device to the pax store management portal. When you attempt to add the serial number, it tells you that the serial number is not in the estate list.
You cannot open the pax store on the device because it will tell you the device isn't registered.

## Resolution
Contact pax store support at paxstore.support@pax.us and ask them to add the serial number to their estate list.
According to Pax support, this occassionally happens when a distributor doesn't get the full list of serial numbers from the manufacturer. 

The error was reported on an L1400 station, but the error can occur on any Pax device.
