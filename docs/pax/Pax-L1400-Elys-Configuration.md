## Configure the L1400 / Elys Solution

Note: This assumes you have wired up the station already. See the KB on the Pax L1400 for details.

1) Wire up the station. 
2) Power on the L1400 and add it to the customer's network.
3) Ensure the firmware is on the latest version. If not, have the processor or whomever is responsible for managing the device perform a push install of the latest L1400 formware.
4) Have the processor or whomever is responsible set the system to restart if possible at 4:30 AM CST. 
5) Ensure that the timezone on the system is correct; That is something that can be set by whomever controls the device via the Pax store admin system.
6) Ensure the Honeybee application and Petunia service are not installed.
- If the honeybee app is installed and you cannot remove it, you are not on the latest firmware.
- The petunia service, if installed, can only be removed via the pax store.
7) Configure any bluetooth devices, such as barcode readers, etc
8) If the customer is using a Pax printer, they will need to change the printer mode to Ethernet, or configure WiFi on the device
9) If the customer is using a connected Pax A3700 card reader, ensure the device is set up properly. See the KB on the Pax A3700.
10) If the customer has a cash drawer, ensure that the drawer is connected to the printer.
11) Install Nimble, either via push install or via the app store.
12) Authorize the register in Nimble
