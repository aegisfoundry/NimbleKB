# How do I create a delivery surcharge?

Create a new service charge, using the "service type" method. 
Select the customer's delivery service type.

Set the fees as appropriate. 

You can set fees up with maximum amounts, and you can mix both flat fees and percentages. For example, $5 plus 5% with a maximum of $10.

If any of the fee is payable to an employee, you can set that up here as well.

The fee will be automatically applied to any orders with the set service type. If you need to disable the fees for an order, you can disable fees from the order options panel, or optionally, tap on the fee in the receipt view from the order and disable that specific fee.

Note that you can also use fees with orders that have service type pricing and credit surcharges.

For example, you may have a menu item "Large 2 Topping Pizza" that is $15.99 in-store, but for delivery is $16.99, plus a $5+5% delivery fee, and when the customer pays with a credit card will get a 3% surcharge. All of these will stack.

However, if you disable the fees for an order, the delivery fee and the credit surcharge will both be disabled. If you only want to remove the delivery fee, tap on the delivery fee in the receipt view of the order and remove the fee from there.
