## I need to configure a promotional price in the system. For example, special pricing on some items for Mothers Day or Valentines Day Weekend.

To create a promo pricing rule, create a new pricing rule in the system (or re-use an old one). Give the price rule a start and end date (and start and end times, if the special only applies during evenings, for example)

Ensure that the price rule comes before any standard rules it needs to overide. 

For example, if your promo is only for dinner but not for lunch, then the promo price would be after a lunch price rule but before the standard or dinner price rule. 

If you already have weekend price rules, then the promo would come before those prices.

*Price rules are checked in order, from the top of the list to the bottom, and the first maching price rule wins*

Set pricing for any items that would be included in the promo.

If an item is only available during the promo period, it would only have a price for that rule.

If the item is always available, but just has a special price during the promo, it would still have the regular prices assigned to the appropriate price rules.
