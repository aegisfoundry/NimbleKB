## How do I accept or process a down payment on a catering order, future event, or similar delayed order?

A typical scenario would be a $10k catering or event order requiring a down payment. There are multiple ways to handle this depending on your business needs:

1) While in the future order, you can add a payment as you would normally add a payment to an order. Note that the card is not kept on file- you will need the card/card number again or another payment method to complete paying for the order.
2) You can pay for a future order (partial or in full) with a house account. From the back office, you can then apply a payment to the house account when the customer payment comes in, either cash, check, or card. When using house accounts for catering, it is recommended each customer receive a unique account.
3) If you use a house account, you can use the optional invoicing system to automatically bill the end-customer and send them a payment link. When they pay the account, the house-account balance will reflect that.
