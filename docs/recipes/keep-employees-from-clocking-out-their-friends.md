## How do I keep employees from having their coworkers clock them in or out?

E.g., I have a cook who comes in late but has a friend clock them in as on-time, or I have someone leave early but their friend clocks them out at the regular time.

Although this is a management issue, there are a few ways to reduce time theft in the system. 

One way to do this is to force employees to use swipe cards to log in. For each user, you can add an optional 'swipe' card for log in. If you pair this by setting a PIN number with the employee ID and do not tell the employee the PIN, they can ONLY log in with a swipe card.

To help prevent the employee from simply giving their swipe card to one of their friends, have the employee use a card that they would be unwilling to share, such as a credit card, bank card, or driver's license.

Note that the system does not store the value of the swipe card. Instead, the POS is storing a non-reversible hash of the data from the magstripe. A hash is a type of mathmatic function that runs against the value of the read and provides a unique and consistent value, but the result cannot be used to reconstruct the original data.
Essentially, you can have an equation of 5+5+5+4 = 19, but just having the value of 19 cannot tell you the values used to get that answer.
