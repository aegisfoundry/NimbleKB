## How do I make an item get an automatic discount?

There are several ways to configure an automatic discount, depending on your specific use-case and how you want to maintain your system.

If all of the items that are on discount are in a special department - e.g., a 'Discount' department, you can set up an automatic item discount rule by department. 
If you have items scattered throughout the system, you can use an automatic discount by tag. Create a tag ('discount', perhaps, but you could use multiple tags for various levels of discount- '10%off', '20%off', etc)
and assign it to the item or items you are discounting. Regardless of where they are in the system, they will receive the discount when they are added to an order.

You can also set discount availability rules based on specific dates, so you could have a clearance rule that applies after Christmas on any items in the Christmas department, for example.
