## How do I create a service charge with a maximum amount? For example, a fee of 5% up to $10.

Service charges have a maximum fee amount that can be set. This works with both percentage based charges and mixing fixed and percentage based charges. When configuring the service charge, simple set the maximum fee amount and the system will stop incrementing the fee when the maximum value is reached.
