## How do I create a happy-hour or other time limited price in the system, such as a lunch price?

To create a time-limited price rule, such as a happy hour or lunch price, create a new price rule in the system. Ensure that the price rule has set start and end times defined in it. 
For example, a happy hour may apply from 4pm to 6pm. If your price rule is only applicable on a few days of the week (for example, Monday through Thursday) set that on the rule as well.

It is recommended that time-limited price rules are given a few minutes of leeway on both the start- and end-times to minimize an unhappy customer whose order did not get entered into the system at 6:02pm, for example.

If an item is only available during happy hour, the item would only have a price in the special price rule.

If an item is always available and just has a special price during the price rule time, then it would still have entries for the other time rules as well.

Place the new price rule above any price rules it should override. For example, if an item has a lunch price, happy hour price, and dinner/standard price, the happy hour price would be after the lunch time and before the dinner / standad price.

*For price rules, the prices are processed in order from top to bottom, with the first matching rule wins.*
