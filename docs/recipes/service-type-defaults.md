## How do I make my employees pick a service type every time an order is created?

For restaurants and bars, ensure that none of your service types are set to "Default". If there are no default service types, the system will force the person creating the order to pick a service type when they start the order.

Retail persona does not currently support forcing a service type selection, and if no "Default" service type is configured, will simply choose the first service type in the system alphabetically.

## How do I make it so the point-of-sale doesn't ask my employeeds to pick a service type every time a new order is created?

Ensure that one of your service types is set to "Default". Only one service type can be set to "Default", and if you need to change it, the server / cashier / etc would need to tap on the service type in the order to change it.
