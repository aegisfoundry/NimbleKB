## How so I create an auto gratuity for parties of 8 or more?

Cretae a new service charge using the "Guest Count" type.

If the autogratuity is fully paid to the employee, you can either set that field to 100%, or leave it blank. If you set it to 0%, none of the autogratuity will be credited to the employee.

Set the guest count to the target number - e.g., 8 or more.

Ensure that the server sets the guest count as part of the order. It is recommended that "require guest count" be required for the service type.
