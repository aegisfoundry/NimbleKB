## How do I create an item with limited availability, such as oinly available during happy hour or during a holiday weekend?

To create an item with limited availability, only assign a price for the price rule that matches the availability window.

For example, if you had a happy hour price and a standard price, the item would only have a happy hour price. Outside of happy hour, the item would not be available to purchase.

Similarly, if you wanted an item only available during the month of October, you could create a price that is only valid from October 1st through the 31st, and only assign the item a price for that price rule.

You can use this logic with any price rule. For example, items only available on certain days of the week, or for certain service types.
