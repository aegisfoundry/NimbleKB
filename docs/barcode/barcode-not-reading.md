# Symptom
The barcode scanner is not reading any barcodes, or is reading garbage

# Troubleshooting
For retail persona, make sure that the system is in "Scan Ready" mode. If if button does not say "Scan Ready", tap on it to re-enable scan mode. 

Ensure the reader is plugged in. You may want to unplug the reader and plug it back in, especially if the reader is not lighting up or beeping.

Close and re-open the point-of-sale.

If this is a new reader, ensure that the reader was set to append a carriage return / enter / return at the end of a barcode read.

If you have other stations available, try the barcode reader on another station.

Power off the station and power it back on.

Exit Nimble and open notepad or similar text application. The barcode scanner should still read the barcode and past the values in notepad. If not, then the barcode reader itself may be broken.
