## Symptom: Pax Elys L1400 register cannot print to the local printer or use the cash drawer.

## Troubleshooting
The L1400 Elys terminal will sometimes come loaded with the apps "Honeybee" or "Petunia". Those applications are intended to simplify configuration of your register environment, but can cause problems by locking out the ability for the point-of-sale to directly communicate with the printer (and cash drawer).

To resolve, you will need to remove the offending application from the register.
* Close the point-of-sale application.
* From the android desktop, find the application (e.g., "Honeybee").
* Press-and-hold the icon until the bubble with "App Info" shows up.
* Press App Info
* Use the "Uninstall App" option to remove the app from your system.

### Note
Some older firmware versions for the L1400 will not let you remove the application. You will need to have the firmware updated from the pax store. 

* If you are and end-customer, please contact your support provider and ask them to update your device's firmware.
* If you are an ISO/VAR, you will need to do a firmware upgrade push task from the pax app store management portal.
