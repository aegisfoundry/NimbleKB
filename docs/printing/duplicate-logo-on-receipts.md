# Symptom: Some receipts print with multiple logos on them, while others may print with no logo.

# Troubleshooting
- If the issue is consistent- every print has a double logo - check the print template they are using. If it is not a stock template, try moving to a stock template to see if that changes the issue.
- Double check all print rules look normal.
- Have the customer restart the printer and the POS station. That fixed this exact issue at least once, so don't knock it until you try it.
