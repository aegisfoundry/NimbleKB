Check the ribbon cartridge is seated properly. Open the front door (the side with the power button). Note- the SP7xx series has a front door (for the ribbon) and rear door (for paper)

The ribbon is a blue cartridge that snaps into place. The winder knob should be on the right side when facing the printer
