## The documentation for the T3180 Pax printer says that ethernet is on by default, but it is not.

## Steps to correct
The Pax T3180 can be connected using WiFI or using Ethernet. However, the two are mutually exclusive, and if WiFi is enabled at all - even if you have not configured it, the ethernet port will not work.

To disable WiFi and enable Ethernet:
* Power off the printer
* Ensure there is a network cable connected between the printer and an active network port
* Open the printer cover (where the paper would be loaded)
* Press and hold both the power and paper feed buttons on top of the printer and hold them for at least three seconds.
* You can release the buttons when the unit beeps
* It will print out a message saying it is enabling Ethernet
* After a moment, the unit will print out its IP address.

To Re-Enable WiFI and disable Ethernet:
* Use the same procedure above, but it will instead enable WiFi.
* You will need to configure WiFI afterwards. Please see the documentation for the printer for instructions on how to do that, but you will need a device with WiFi to configure the printer.
