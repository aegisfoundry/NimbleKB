In order for cash discount to print on the receipt, all of the following must be true:

There is a discount rule for the cash discount:
	• The discount is of type auto order, fixed percentage. This won't work with auto item discounts (I’m talking to you, Joseph!)
	• The discount name has a set percentage
	• The discount has a receipt name
	• The discount is set to override item rules
	• The discount is set to only apply to cash payment types
	• The receipt XML has cash discount lines in it
