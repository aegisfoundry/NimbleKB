Taxes allow for system taxes to be configured.
 
Taxes can be as granular as you wish. For example, you can create individual city, county, and state taxes, or you can create a single tax rate that encompasses all of those.
 
To configure taxes, click or tap on the "Taxes" page under the "Configuration" gear icon.

A tax must have a name and a tax rate.
 
Setting a tax as a default tax means that the tax will be applied by default to any new items added to the system. Existing items will not have that tax retroactively applied.
 
You can have multiple taxes listed as default; For example, if you have configured a city tax, county tax, and state tax, you can set all of these as a default tax so that any new items created will automatically have all three taxes applied to them.
