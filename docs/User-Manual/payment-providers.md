Payment Providers allow you to configure the payment methods your store will accept, including credit cards, gift cards, and "Paid Outside Providers" which are essentially house accounts that allow an employee to specify that an order was paid for with an outside system, such as Venmo, Square, invoice, or other mechanism.
 
To configure payment providers, tap or click on the "Payments" page under the "Configuration" gear icon.

All payment providers will need a name configured, as well as a payment type (Cash or credit), as well as a provider selected from the list of drop-downs. 
 
Note that many payment providers only require a device type to be selected, such as a Pax Ethernet device.

Please note that the register will also need additional configuration for each payment provider. For example, the register configuration will allow the manager to specify which credit card reader a specific register will use.
 
Please see "Register Management"

You may also optionally configure a payment to require a specific minimium permission. For example, you can configure checks to require an assistant manager.
 
Note that if you apply a permission to using a Nimble Gift Card payment provider, this will also restrict the sale of gift cards to the minimum permission.
 
If you do not set a minimum permission, any position can use the payment type.
