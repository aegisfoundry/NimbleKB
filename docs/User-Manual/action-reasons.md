Action Reasons are pre-defined options for certain actions in the point-of-sale system that a manager may wish to have additional details as to why something was performed.
 
For example, a void may require an action reason to explain why the void was made. A discount used for comping an order may require a reason why the discount was used. Paid-in or Paid-Out events may require additional detail, such as a tip out or starting cash paid-in.
 
Any part of the system that uses action reasons will always allow the user to manually type in a value, but action reasons provide a fast and easy to way handle common scenarios and can be chosen from a list of relevant action reasons when prompted.

The category will determine where the action reason is allowed to be used, including discounts, voids, paid-ins, paid-outs, and inventory transactions.
