If you disable tipping, the system will not permit orders to contain tips. 
 
Disabling cash tipping will prevent employees from entering tips on cash orders like they would with credit card orders.
 
Enforcing end-of-shift tip declaration will force any employee that (1) is clocked in and (2) has orders for that business day to declare any cash tips they have received for the shift instead of entering the tips as they go. 
 
Holdbacks are reporting tools that allow the store to calculate tip values after holdbacks, such as charging credit card fees to servers on tips. 

You can optional enable Tip Sharing or Tip Pooling, exclusive of each other.
- Tip Sharing allows for tipped employees to transfer part of their non-cash tips to other employees (tip-out)
- Tip Pooling is a mechanism to assist sites that tip pools by allowing a manager to distribute the tips between eligible employees.

See the specific documentation on each function for more details.
