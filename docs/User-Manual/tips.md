 You can configure the way the system handles tips in the tip configuration control panel. 
 
To configure tips, click or tap on the "Tip Configuration" page under the "Configuration" gear icon.

If you disable tipping, the system will not permit orders to contain tips. 
 
Disabling cash tipping will prevent employees from entering tips on cash orders like they would with credit card orders.
 
Enforcing end-of-shift tip declaration will force any employee that (1) is clocked in and (2) has orders for that business day to declare any cash tips they have received for the shift instead of entering the tips as they go. 
 
Holdbacks are reporting tools that allow the store to calculate tip values after holdbacks, such as charging credit card fees to servers on tips.
