Service Charges allow a store manager or owner to create charges that will be added to an order based on different criteria, including the service type (See Service Types), Payment Type, Guest Count, Order Total, or Item Tags.

To create a new service charge, go to the "Service Charges" page in under configuration and click or tap "Add"
 
You can set both a flat fee in dollars and a percentage fee. If you specify both, then both will be applied to applicable orders. For example, Setting a flat fee of $5.00 plus a percentage fee of 5% will result in a $100 order being charged $10 for the service fee- $5, plus 5% of $100.
 
You may also elect to enter a maximum fee amount, which will place a hard limit on the charge.

You can also direct some percentage of the service charge to be payable to the employee who handled the ordered. This is typically used in situations like an autogratuity that is paid to the employees with their tips.
 
## Charges by Service Type
Charges by service type require that an existing configured service type be selected. For example, if you are creating a delivery service charge, you would create a service type for delivery orders (See Service Types) so you can select the "Delivery" service type from the drop down list below.

## By Payment Type
Payment type surcharges are charges or fees added by your payment processor. For example, if you set a 3% surcharge for credit card orders with your payment provider, you can use a payment service charge to provide a specific name to that charge. 
However, the actual charges are set and maintained by the payment provider, not the point-of-sale system. The Payment Type surcharge allows a store to give the charge a specific name that would show up on the receipt.

** Note that fees by payment type cannot be disabled in the POS **

## Dual Charge
This is essentially by Payment Type, but the actual charge is set by the Point of Sale System, and the fees can be disabled on the order.

## By Guest Count
You can create a service charge by guest count. If you are using guest count in the system (See Seat Tracking), you can set a surcharge to be added to party sizes at or above the set threshold. For example, you can create a 20% surcharge for parties of 8 or more.

## By Order Total
You can set surcharges based on the order total. For example, if you wished to add a 20% surcharge to orders over $1,000, you can set that here.

## By Item Tag
Surcharges can be configured to trigger based on an item's tag. For example, f there is a sudden surge in ingredient prices at a restaurant - such as eggs or chicken wings - a manager can create a surcharge to cover the short-term difference in food costs instead of re-printing entire menus.

## Auto Gratuity â€“ End of Day
Surcharges can be used by the autogratuity End of Day module, which allows stores that use pre-authorized cards to close any open orders with pre-auth payments attached at the end of the evening with an additional service charge.

## Taxing Surcharges
 
Surcharges can be configured to be taxable items. On all surcharge type except for payment type surcharges, you will have a second screen that will allow you to turn various configured taxes on or off for the surcharge.
 
Laws on taxation of surcharges may vary from location to location so please check with local authorities or tax experts if you are unsure as to if a charge is taxable or not.
