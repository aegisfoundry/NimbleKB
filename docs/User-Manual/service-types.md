A service type is a method for differentiating different ways an order is managed. For example, a restaurant might employee service types for "Dine In", "Delivery", and "Bar". A retail establishment may use "In Store" and "Online"
 
A store must have at least one service type.

To create a service type, navigate to the "Service Types" under the "Configuration" gear icon and tap or click "Add"
 
A service type must have a name.
 
You can mark an existing service type as inactive by toggling the "Active" switch on the top, which will prevent the service type from being used going forward. For example, if a store decides to no longer use a "Delivery" service type, it can be marked inactive to prevent servers from using it again.
 
If a service type is set to default, it will be automatically set when a new order is created.
 
Note that there can only be one default service type. If you set a second service type as default, it will reset all other service types to not being the default.
 
If you do not set a default service type, the user will be prompted to select a service type when a new order is created.
 
If a store's business is primarily a single service type, the manager may choose to set a default and rely on their employees to change the service type manually in the order.
 
Each service type can have different requirements configured, including requiring a table number, guest count, guest name, or credit card pre-auth.
 
Any options set as a requirement will prompt the employee creating a new order to fill in that information before they can continue with the order.
 
For example, a restaurant may want to require delivery and carry out orders set a Guest Name, but table service orders may require a table number and guest count, and bar orders a pre-auth transaction.

## Pre Auth
If you configure a required pre-auth, you will need to set the amount to pre-auth the customer's credit card, and select an already configured payment provider (See Payment Providers).
