# Tip Sharing
Tip sharing allows servers to send a portion of their tips to other employees who were logged in during that business day. This avoids the tipped employee from paying taxes on tips that were tipped out / shared with other employees.

Control of tip sharing is left to the tipped employee.

## Configuration
To enable tip sharing, go into the “Tip Configuration” section of the back office and enable tip sharing. Note that you cannot have “Tip Sharing” and “Tip Pooling” enabled at the same time.

## Tip Sharing Actions
Under the timeclock panel for an employee, the servers can go into “Tips”

### Tip Management Panel
From their tip management panel, they can see their tips and gratuities, declare additional tips not otherwise captured in the system, see their tip history, or transfer tips to other employees.
The transferrable tips section lists the total amount of tips that are eligible for sharing / tipout.

*Cash tips are not eligible for tip sharing in the system. To share cash tips, the tipped employee should share the cash tips with other employees prior to declaring their cash tips. The employees receiving  shared cash tips are responsible for declaring cash tips in their panel at the end of their shift.*

*Gratuities are currently not eligible for sharing / splitting in the system.*

### Declaring Tips
To declare additional tips, the employee would tap “Declare Tips” and enter in the total amount of tips they wish to declare. This is typical for cash tips reported at the end of the shift.

Declaring credit tips and gratuities as well as cash gratuities is not required; Those are already captured in the system. Additionally, if a cash tip was recorded on an order as a tip adjustment using the same process as credit tips, they do not need to be separately declared.

 
### Transferring Tips
To transfer or share a tip, the tipped employee would tap “Transfer Tip” 
They will be prompted to select the employe that they are going to tip out. Note that only employees who were clocked into the system are eligible for tip transfers / sharing.

The tipped employee will be asked how much of their sharable tips they want to send to that employee, up to the maximum amount of sharable tips. When they have entered in the amount, they will press “save” to send the tip.

### Employee Shift Report
If an employee prints an employee shift report, the total of any tip shares will be listed under their tip summary, as well as a list of any tip outs they have performed, allowing the server to verify their tips.
