Close Tab is a feature designed to help bars and restaurants with bars or other businesses that utilize credit card pre-authorization. The feature allows a business to close out any open tabs with valid pre-authorizations at the end of the night with a single press of a button, adding in a service charge that can be applied to the server as a gratuity, kept by the store, or split between them.
 
This is also separate from Auto Close, which is a separate feature that will end the day automatically for you. Note that Auto Close cannot close out pre-auth tickets. You can use both features of the system.

Note that Close Tabs requires a configured service charge configured for Auto Gratuity End of Day to be configured, and it must be run from an authorized terminal on the local network. You cannot run close tabs remotely.

Navigate to the plug-in menu, and choose the “Close Tabs” option.

The system will show how many open orders are in the system and how many are processable. 
The system can only close out open orders that have a pre-authorized payment.
If you see any warnings, you can tap on the red “?” to get more information.

Tap on Process to process the eligible order.
The system will walk through each order, add the configured service charge, and close the order.

**Note- If an order already has a payment attached, such as a pre-auth that was already converted to a payment but the order not yet closed, the order will be closed with no additional service charge added.**
