If enabled, Auto EoD allows you to configure how the store will handle the End-of-Day process. Note that if you do not enable auto End-of-Day, you will need to close the day manually (See the End-of-Day section for more details.)

From here, you can:
* Enable or disable the auto EoD function
* Set the system to close any open orders with payments
* Void any open orders without payments
* Advance open orders into the next business day
* Reconcile drawers
* Clock out any still-clocked in employees at a given time
* Automatically start a new business day.

If you do not configure the system to handle open orders, either via closing/voiding or advancing, managing clocked-in employees, and reconciling any open drawers, the day will not advance and you will need to handle those manually when you come in the next business day.

Any drawers that are reconciled as part of the auto EOD process are automatically marked as accurate. The system cannot count cash in a drawer or a serverâ€™s pocket.

Even if your store processes include manually running EoD, you can leave auto EoD enabled. If the day has already been closed, the system will not process another day.

Likewise, if your store uses auto EoD, it is best practice to close out the timeclock, drawers, and orders every night to ensure the closing manager has dealt with any issues before the end of the evening.
