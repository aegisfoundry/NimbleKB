If you are using a Brecknell or compatible serial port scale, you can configure the scale under Apps.

Tap "add" to add a new scale, or tap on a scale and select "Edit" to edit the parameters of the scale.

You will need to give the scale a friendly name and associate the scale with a configured register.
 
You will need to know the COM port the device is connected to (either physical, or virtual COM port over USB), the configured baud rate, data byte size, parity configuration, and number of stop bits.

Any changes to a scale's configuration will require the POS software to be restarted.
