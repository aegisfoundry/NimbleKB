### Store Info and Address
The Store Info and Address sections are used to provide basic information about your store, including the store name, phone number, and address.
 
This information is used in multiple parts of the system, including receipt printing, so be sure that the information is correct as you would want it displayed to customers.
 
### Defaults, Time and End of Day
 
Time and End of Day allows a store manager to set their store's timezone, the start of their pay week, the minimum number of hours per day and minimum number of orders per day (Used for protection against accidental manual End of Day processes being run), allow for the previous business day to be re-opened (Uncommon), and for the store's "start hour" to be set, which controls when a store is allowed to manually run a "start day" operation.
 
You can also change the system’s default language from here. Note that an employee can be set with their own language preference, which will override the system language on the terminal they are using. The terminal will revert to the system’s default language when they log back out.

### Order Configuration
 
Order configuration allows you to specify order-centric requirements for your store.
 
Table and Seat tracking can be turned on to allow for the tracking of table numbers and seat assignments.

Auto-Close items will automatically complete simple items with no workflow or forced modifiers when the item is added to the order. This reduces complexity when adding simple items with no modifiers to an order. Note that items can be modified after being added by tapping on the item in the receipt view.
 
"Enforce Timeclock" will require all non-managers to clock in to the point-of-sale system before they are allowed to use it. Employees with a Manager-level permission are exempt from this requirement.
