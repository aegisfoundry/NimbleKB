# Tip Pooling

Tip pooling allows for stores to track pooled tips and gratuities, and distribute them among eligible employees. A store manager is responsible for tip allocation from the back office. Tip pool adjustments can be made for prior business days, so they do not have to be adjusted prior to closing the day in the system.

When enabled, ALL tips and employee gratuities are pooled. The system cannot pool some tips but exclude some employee tips from the pool.

## Configuration

To enable tip pooling, you will need to enable the feature in the back office under the ‘Configuration’, ‘Tips’ section.

With tip pooling enabled, you can choose to exclude positions from the tip pool. For example, manager positions, sick/vacation positions, etc, may be excluded as needed.

To exclude positions, tap on the enabled positions count button and select the positions that are eligible for tip pooling. Unchecked positions will be excluded from tip pooling eligibility.

Tap ‘Done’ when finished.

Be sure to save your changes by tapping ‘Save’ at the bottom of the tip configuration page.

## Usage
Tip pooling does not have any changes in front-of-house operations. Any declared tips, either manually or from credit card payments, will be automatically added to the eligible tips for the day.

*Note: When using Tip Pooling, employees should not individually declare their share of tips. They can declare tips from orders, but ALL tips are added to the pool, and are distributed and managed through this system when it is enabled.*

Managers will have a new page available in the back office under the “End of Day” Checkered flag icon for “Tip Pooling”.

By default, the page will be set to the current business date. To change, tap on the business date and select the date you wish to edit. You can edit any prior day’s pooled tip allocation, but values edited after payroll will not be reflected on employee’s paychecks unless an updated payroll report is pulled.

*All changes to pooled tip allocation are audit logged.*

The page will show the total orders for the selected date, the total tips for the day,  the unallocated tip total, and any eligible employees who had clocked in for that business date.

To add in tips not tracked in the system – for example, online tips from third-party sources – tap “Declare Tips” and enter in the total amount of tips being declared.

## Distributing Tips and Gratuities
Tips and gratuities can be allocated to employees either manually or automatically. To change between tips and gratuities, tap the “Tips” or “Gratuities” button on the right side of the panel.

*For legal compliance reasons, tips and gratuities must be allocated separately.*

To manually set an amount for a tip or gratuity, share, tap on the employee in the list and enter in the amount you wish to allocate to that employee.

You can also allocate automatically, either by hours worked or evenly for all eligible employees by using the buttons above the employee list. You can still manually adjust an employee’s tip or gratuity allocation after using the automatic buttons, but you cannot allocate more than is unallocated in the system. 

If you make a mistake, you can tap on ‘reset’ to un-allocate tips or gratuities from all employees. Note that ‘Reset’ will only reset the currently selected type – tip or gratuity.

Note that if you have previously saved changes to a business date’s tip adjustment and then reset the tips for the day, you will need to re-allocate the tips before you can save your changes.

To save your tip allocations, tap on the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

 
## Viewing Tip Ins from Tip Pooling

An employee can see any tip-ins from tip pooling by using the “Tips” button under the “Timeclock” button in the system.

All pooled tip and gratuity allocations will show as non-cash.
