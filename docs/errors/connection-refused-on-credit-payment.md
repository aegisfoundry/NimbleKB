## The POS reports a "Connect Error", "Connection Refused", or "Port Error" on attempting a credit payment

## Troubleshooting

The POS is unable to establish communication with the payment device.

Ensure the payment device is powered on, connected to the network, and the payment application is running.

Have the customer retry the payment if they have not already done so.

Restart the payment device and retry the payment once it has completed starting back up.

Ensure the POS register is connected to the network. If the system reports itself as offline, ensure the network cables or Wifi for the device are connected properly.
