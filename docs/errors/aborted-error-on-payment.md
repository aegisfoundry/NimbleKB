## The POS reports an "ABORTED" error on credit card payment 

## Troubleshooting
The system returning an "ABORTED" usually indicates the customer has canceled the payment from the payment device.

It is also possible that if the payment app is manually closed on the card reader while waiting for a card, it may return the aborted error to the POS before the payment application closes.
