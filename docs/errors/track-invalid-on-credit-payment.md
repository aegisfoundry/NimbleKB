## The system reports a "TRACK INVALID" error on payment

## Troubleshooting

The card swipe did not read and the payment device returned an error.

Have the customre re-try the payment.

If this continues to happen on a card:
* Try wiping the card down; if there is dirt or grease on the mag stripe, it may cause read errors.
* Try putting a piece of paper around the card's magstripe and rerun the card.
* Try another reader if possible.
* Enter the card number on the reader manually.


### If this error occurs on all or most card reads, the payment device itself may need service or replacement.
