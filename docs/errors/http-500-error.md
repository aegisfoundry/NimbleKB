 ## Troubleshooting

 The 500 error is being returned from the payment provider or the device. This indicates that either the payment network/gateway is having issues, or the card reader is malfunctioning.

 Have the customer retry the payment. 
 If they continue to get a 500 error, have them confirm interet access.
 If the error still persists, have them unplug power to the card reader and plug it back in (power cycle).
 If the error continues to persist, they will need to contact their payment provider.  Note that is a network is having issues, this will likely be a wide-spread problem and multiple customers may report this at the same time.
