Symptom:
All of an employees orders are being voided when they are closed, and the orders won't print. The user is not voiding the order.
The order audit log will say "Voided order from Order Window"

Troubleshooting:
Make sure the employee is not clocked in with a job position that has the "training" permisison.
The training permission will automatically void orders upon saving them -- this is expected behavior. 

Do not use training permissions for employee roles that are actively taking orders.
