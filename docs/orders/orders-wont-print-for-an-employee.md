Symptom: 
None of the orders put in from an employee will print when on closed. Other employee orders print fine.

Troubleshooting:
Verify that the order is being closed instead of being voided.
If the orders are being voided, check to see if the employee is logging in as a training position. 
Orders being voided and not printing is expected behavior for training modes.
