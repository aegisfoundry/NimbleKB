## When searching for an order form a previous day, the order is not found

## Troubleshooting

* Check your date and order number to make sure you are searching the correct date and/or order number.
* Check your order filter fiews at the top of the register. If you are set to only see "My Orders" or "This Registers Orders", you will only see orders that match that critiera. When searching for a past-day order, ensure your older filter is set to "All Orders"
* Ensure the client is online. The POS only stores the current day's order information locally, so if your register does not have internet access, it will not be able to search past day orders.
