## Resetting the Application

If Nimble will not launch or has other issues on a specific device that is not related to configuration, you may want to try resetting the application. Resetting the application just deletes the local data for the application, so if the orders from a system have synced up to the cloud (e.g., other registers can see all of the orders and recent changes) then this is a non-destructive process.

** IF YOU ARE MISSING ORDERS OR DATA FROM A REGISTER, DO NOT RESET THE APPLICATION - CONTACT SUPPORT !! **

Resetting an application will force you to log back in to the register with the authorized email and password of a configured manager or support user. Be sure to have that information for that store ready.

## Windows
* Go to the Nimble application in the start menu.
* Right click on the application and go to "App Settings"
* Choose "Reset the Application"


If this does not fix your issue, try uninstalling the application and reinstalling it from the app store.

## Android / PAX
* On the android deskop, push and long hold the "NimblePOS" application icon.
* Select "App Info"
* Select "Storage and Cache"
* Select "Clear Storage"
* Select "Clear Cache"

If this does not fix your issue, try uninstalling the application and reinstalling it from the app store.

## iOS / IpadOS
iPads do not support resetting an application. You will need to uninstall and re-install the application.
