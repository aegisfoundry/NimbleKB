## Microsoft App Store Errors

### Store is not installed
This is typically a windows 10 POS issue. Many windows 10 registers ship with a version of windows 10 called LTSC (or LTSB/LTSA, but those are too old to work with Nimble).

LTSC is a locked down, long-term support version of Windows 10 that does not natively come with the microsoft app store installed, but it is possible to install the app store manually.

Please see the entry on "Installing the Microsoft App Store"

### Nimble won't install from app store, error code 0x80073CF3
This indicates that you already have a version of Nimble installed but the update tool does not see it to update. Most typically seen when converting from a beta installation to the main appstore version of Nimble. Uninstall all existing Nimble installations on the system and retry the app store install.


### Your Browser is out of date error

Ensure that Microsoft Edge is installed on the station.

This error is not a problem; You can tap/click on "Open Store app" if you have Edge installed.
