## Installing on a Pax device (e.g., L1400, etc)

To install on a Pax device, first ensure that the device is on the latest firmware. If not, the manager of the device must do a push task to the newest firmware edition from their Pax device manager.

If you are not the party controlling the devices, contact your device manager to conduct this task.

You can do a push-install of the NimblePOS app from the app store. There are no variables required because all setup/configuration is done inside of the application itself.

You can also find NimblePOS in the Pax store and install it that way if you do not have a manager for the device.
